# gaanaplaylistdownloader
Gaana Playlist Downloader which downloads all songs from playlist thru mymp3song [.] org site and also creates a csv file.
So now you can easily download any playlist, or make your own and then download it.
# How to use
Make sure python is installed.

    Run: `python gaanaplaylistdownloader <playlist-url>`
    
# ToDo
  1. Add clipboard default
  2. Divide in two files, one for scrapping, and other for downloading choosen ones.
  3. Add more sources
  4. Add support for single songs as well.
  5. Add an option to let chrome handle download. (For better file management?)
  6. Freaking documentation. The code is a mess right now.
  
### P.S.
  *This is just for learning web scraping and python, don't use it for, um, anything, except looking.*
